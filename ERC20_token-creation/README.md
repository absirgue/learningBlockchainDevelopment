📍 Simple Smart Contract and brownie deployment scripts to learn the basics of deploying an ERC20 token by utilizing the OpenZeppelin's ERC20 interface. This build's main inten was really to learn about the ERC20 standard and to demonstrate that launching a simple token only required a very small effort. More advanced projects around tokens and their utilizations will be coming !
