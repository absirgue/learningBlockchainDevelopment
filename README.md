# learningBlockchainDevelopment

🌱 Blockchain is a technlogy that passionates me as it offers amazing opportunities to disrupt the world. Crypto has been crazy the past few years, the public discovered NFTs and their power with a crazy boom in the past few months, and DeFi is already a growing industry. Blockchain also finds applications in many other sectors and I am sure that it will be a great tool to build a more sustainable world and to revolution many other industries like healthTech, agTech, supply chain management, data privacy, real estate, education, ...

👨‍🎓 I want to master the tools needed to participate in this revolution and this is why I did a first step in learning blockchaind development by folowing PatrickAlphaC's "Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course – Beginner to Expert Python Tutorial" course on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel. It is an amazing course and I thank PatrickAlphaC for making it so readily available on the internet. This course allowed to get a first grasp at blockchaind development and to strat working on my own projects and applications to utilize those tools and master them even further.

📍 This repository shows the main activities completed when following this course. As of 02/10/22, a few of the activities are missing but I will add them soon.
